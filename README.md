## Introduction: Overview of Linear and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset Description
## Linear Regression: Sales Data Set
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises detailed sales information, including product specifications, sales figures, and customer demographics. The dataset encompasses various attributes such as product categories, pricing, quantities sold, and customer characteristics, making it a rich resource for analyzing sales performance. By employing linear regression techniques, you can uncover relationships between these variables to predict future sales trends, identify key factors influencing sales, and enhance strategic decision-making for marketing and inventory management.

## Logistic Regression: Breast Cancer Data Set
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dataset contains 569 instances of breast cancer tumors, each described by 30 numerical features. These features capture various characteristics of cell nuclei present in digitized images of a breast mass, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. Each tumor is labeled as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), making this dataset ideal for binary classification tasks. The goal of the logistic regression analysis is to predict the class label (benign or malignant) based on the features of the tumor, helping to improve early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
This dataset is commonly used for evaluating classification algorithms, especially in medical diagnostics, and provides a valuable real-world application of logistic regression for predicting health outcomes.
